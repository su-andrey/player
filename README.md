# Player
## Small description
An interesting project made back in 2022. A music player with basic functionality. Start, rewind, switch back and forth for songs, volume control, track sorting, popularity and favorites system, 
two types of themes, several types of fonts. The ability to create and delete custom playlists. The main feature is the ability to search through the system: a directory is selected (with any number 
of nesting levels) and the program automatically collects music in the specified format, providing the user with a ready-made list.
## Repository structure
Since the project was done a long time ago and was not published on Github in a timely manner, all files were added in one commit and the structure is not clear. the dist directory contains the final
one .an exe file from which you can run the entire program, some technical pictures, as well as the database necessary for operation. Also, for the convenience of demonstrating the search, it also 
contains several directories with .mp3 files and one with .wav files. The root directory contains the source files in the .py format.
